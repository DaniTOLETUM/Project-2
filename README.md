# WanderFull Project

## Contain
This is the second project made By Daniel Diaz and Yagmur Bakici in Ironhack Bootcamp.
The project, made in one week, is an app that allow users to select different routes in different cities (travel guide).

To make the app, we used Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Google Maps Api.

The admin of the app, is able to manage the users registered, select diferent points of places from the map to create after routes for display in the user interface.

You can see the app running in this link:
